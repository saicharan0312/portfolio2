      "Developed services in Java to extract categories, devices, features, and actions from a Large Language Model (LLM)",
      "The LLM generates requests in the form of GET or POST. For example, switch on the light would be a POST request, while get the brightness of the light would be a GET request.",
      "Our team verifies whether the user is configured to interact with a specific device and whether the requested feature and action are enabled.",
      "If the request is valid, it is forwarded downstream to execute the action; otherwise, it is sent back to the LLM with a nicely written statements to customers.", 
      "Utilized Java and built a CDK pipeline to monitor failures, with a dashboard for visibility. High-severity failures trigger alarms. We also tracked metrics for each request to identify and rectify issues.",
      "This pipeline ensures that a Pull Request (PR) is raised only after all unit tests, functional tests, and execution sequences pass successfully.",
      "Our team conducts code reviews where everyone is involved to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end flow of our services."
